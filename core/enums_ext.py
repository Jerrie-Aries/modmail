    Replaced the legacy guild-based permissions (i.e., manage channels, manage messages).
    This system enables you to customize your desired permission level specific to a command
    or a group of commands for a role or user.

    There are five valid permission levels:

        - ADMINISTRATOR [4]

    By default, all newly set up Modmail will have `OWNER` set to the owner of the bot, and `REGULAR`
    set to @everyone.

    Every commands should have one of these permission levels wrapped on them. Otherwise, the level INVALID [-1]
    will automatically be set to those without the permission level wrapper.
